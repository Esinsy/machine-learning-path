### Pandas Tutorial

# 🐼 What is Pandas?

**Pandas** is a fast, powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use open-source library for data analysis and data manipulation in Python.  
It provides two primary data structures:  
- **Series**: One-dimensional labeled arrays (like an enhanced list)  
- **DataFrame**: Two-dimensional labeled tabular data (like an Excel sheet but more powerful)  

Pandas is widely used in:  
- 📊 **Data Cleaning** (handling missing values, fixing data types)  
- 📈 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- 🧮 **Statistical computations and aggregations**  
- 🔗 **Merging, joining, and reshaping datasets**  
- 🚀 **Data preparation for Machine Learning**
