# **Lesson 01: Loading Data**

This notebook covers the basics of loading datasets into Python using **pandas**.  
Weâ€™ll practice reading CSV files, exploring datasets, and preparing data for analysis.



### ðŸ“¥ **Importing the Pandas Library**

In this cell, we import the **pandas** library and assign it the alias `pd`, which is the standard convention in the Python community.

Pandas provides powerful data structures such as `DataFrame` and `Series` that allow for efficient data manipulation, loading, filtering, aggregation, and much more â€” especially when working with CSV, Excel, SQL, or JSON data.

> âœ… `pd` is the commonly used alias and makes the code more concise.


```python
import pandas as pd
```

### ðŸ“„ **Loading the Laptop Dataset from Alexey Grigorev's GitHub Repository**

Here, we load a dataset containing information about various laptop models from an online CSV file using the `read_csv()` function from pandas.

- `pd.read_csv()` is used to read comma-separated values (CSV) files into a `DataFrame`, which is a tabular data structure with labeled axes.
- The dataset is hosted on GitHub and is accessed directly via its raw URL.
- The resulting variable `df` now holds the entire dataset and can be used for further analysis and preprocessing.

> ðŸ”— URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexeygrigorev/datasets/master/laptops.csv


```python
df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexeygrigorev/datasets/master/laptops.csv')
```

```python
df.head()
```

```python

```
